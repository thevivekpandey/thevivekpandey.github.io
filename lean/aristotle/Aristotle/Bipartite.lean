Bipartite matching "rank" and the bound   rank G ≤ N (N - 1) / 2.

Encoding
--------
* The bipartite graph  G = (U, V, E)  with  |U| = |V| = N  is given by its edge
  relation  `E : Fin N → Fin N → Prop`  (the biadjacency relation:  `E i j`  means
  the i-th vertex of U is joined to the j-th vertex of V).
* A perfect matching is a permutation  `π : Equiv.Perm (Fin N)`  with  `E i (π i)`
  for every `i`.
* For a permutation `π`,        f(π, x, y) = ∑ᵢ xⁱ · y^(π i).
* For `n : ℕ`,                  g(n, x, y) = ∑_{π a matching} sign(π) · f(π, x, y)ⁿ.
* `rank G` is the least `n` with `g(n, ·, ·) ≠ 0`   (and `∞` if there is none).

The theorem is stated; its proof is left as `sorry`.
