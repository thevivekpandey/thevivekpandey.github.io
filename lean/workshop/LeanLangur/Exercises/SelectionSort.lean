## Exercise: Selection Sort

In this exercise, we implement Selection Sort using a helper function `smallest` that finds the smallest element in a non-empty list. We then prove that Selection Sort preserves membership and that the resulting list is sorted.

The theorems you need to prove are marked with `sorry` as placeholders.

We now do the same for smallest.

def smallest (l: List α) (h: l ≠ []) : α :=

  | x :: y :: xs =>
    min x (smallest (y :: xs) (by simp))

We now implement Selection Sort using smallest.
