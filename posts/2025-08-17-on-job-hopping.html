<h1>Job change and illusion of progress</h1>

<p>
My father was in government service, and so he was in a single job all his career. I now see
that there were many times when he was frustrated because of bad bosses, or bad postings, or
other problems, but there was no possibility of "changing jobs", that was just not a concept.
Thankfully, we in tech industry are in a free world - we can change jobs as frequently as we
wish (though we must find companies that are ready to employ us).
</p>

<p>
However, with power comes responsibilities, and I think people log out of their jobs too frequently,
and for wrong reasons. In this article I elucidate on one wrong reason to change your job.
</p>

<p>
When you join a new job, initially, you have to put a lot of effort - there is a lot of nomenclature
to understand, and lot of things to understand about the processes - code reviews, testing, deployment,
monitoring, on call, etc. Note that these learnings are not <em>fundamental</em>, every team's
evolution is different, and its needs are different and they converge on some process best suited
to them. Learning these proceses makes you useful in this company, but other than a few fundamentals,
these learnings are not useful, for the most part, at any other place. You may also need to learn a
lot of tools and components which your company uses.
For instance, at Google
I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_(source_control_system)">piper</a> (rather than git) 
for version control, <a href="https://research.google/pubs/large-scale-cluster-management-at-google-with-borg/">borg</a>
(instead of kubernetes) for cluster management, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview">pubsub</a>
(rather than kafka) for message service. I spent time learning those tools, but now that I don't work
at Google, those learnings are no longer useful.
</p>

<p>
So, initially, there is a lot of effort, and you may feel like you are learning many new things, 
most of the things are not fundamental - they are just needed to get around in your company. However, your
output is quite low - because your time is getting spent in ramping up.
</p>

<p>
Now, as time passes by, contextual things - the tools and the processes and the conventions and the keywords
are all learnt, and thus you can put effort in solving actual problems, and thus your output increases. You
feel happy about this - you can do make real contributions to company.
</p>

<p>
As time passes by, if you keep up the effort, you become ever more proficient. You can not only solve your
problems quickly, you can also help other team mates and also people outside your immediate team in solving
their problems.
</p>

<p>
If you have reached this point, congratulaitons! You have enough technical acumen and people acumen to be 
very productive person in the company. But, before of a trap! Now, there is the next level to unlock and
it depends on your temperament whether are able to unlock it or not.
</p>

<p>
At this point, one of several things can happen.
</p>

<p>
One possibility is that you may decide to slack off. You have long learnt all the terminologies, you know all
the tools and you can keep coasting - generally do a good work with not too much effort. You will slowly 
stagnate.
</p>

<p>
Second possibility is that you get bored and you are unable to figure out that there is next level to unlock.
