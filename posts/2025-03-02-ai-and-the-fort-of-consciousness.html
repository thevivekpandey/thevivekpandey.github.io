<h1>AI and the fort of consciousness</h1>
<img src="ai-advancement.png" width="600px"/>
<p>
Scientific advances "explain away" what is otherwise magical and metaphysical. In this article we explore how
scientific advances in general and AI advances in particular are reducing the set of attributes we regard
as uniquely human.
</p>

<p>
Stars were thought by some ancient cultures to be different worlds, or manifestations of gods. Today we think
of them as burning gases, like our Sun.
</p>

<p>
There is immense variety of life on earth - plants and animals and bacteria and fishes etc. The best explanation
earlier was that God created them all. But now we understand that all life evolved from single celled organisms.
All the complexity that we see today is a result of evolution. At each step of reproduction, offsprings are slightly
different (as a result of genetic mutation), and the offsprings carrying the mutations most suitable for survival
perform the next step of reproduction. All the intricate morphology and behaviors of the organisms can be explained.
</p>

<p>
For a long time it was thought that organic compounds - the ones which living things (plants and animals) are made
up of - can only be made by living things. But then in 1828, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6hler_synthesis">synthesized urea</a> in lab and since
then many organic compounds have been synthesized in lab, leading to loss of magic in organic compounds.
</p>

<p>
Notable here is the celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment">Miller-Urey experiment</a>
where Miller and Urey tried to create the environment of early earth and were able to create several amino acids, which are the
building blocks of living cells. They could not create living cells though.
</p>

<p>
This arc of scientific progress of explaining various attributes we think are unique to humans or to living things collides with our 
tendency to think that "We are special" - Indians are very proud of their ancient culture and Americans talk
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism">American Exceptionalism</a>. 
There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_exceptionalism">Chinese Exceptionalism</a> called - 中国例外主义 too.
In terms of religion - of course, everyone's religion is the one true right path and it
is silly not to follow that path.
</p>

<p>
As living beings and as humans, these beliefs are even stronger. There is a strong belief that living things are special.
They feel pain and pleasure and non living things don't. There is the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism">Panpsychism</a>
though which says that mind like aspect is ubiqutuous feature of reality, not confined to living beings. But it is a fringe theory. And then among living
beings humans are particularly superior - they alone have the power to think and do long term planning. Their consciousness
is the most evolved (if at all we grant that non humans have consciousness).
</p>

<p>
However, bit by bit, our special ness is slipping away. Let's see how it is slipping away in the area of mind.
</p>

<p>
First, the machines could calculate faster than us. Well that was a mechanical task. In principle we could also calculate
anything, it is just a matter of speed - and silicon can calculate faster than organic neurons.
</p>

<p>
Then machines could play chess better than us. As long as they were doing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">Alpha beta pruning</a>
we could rest assured that they are just using their computing prowess, but don't have any intuition of the game. Look - this
approach was able to defeat best chess player (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov">See here</a>), but
never the best go player. This is partly because chess has fewer positions than go - $10^{46}$ vs $10^{180}$ and chess positions are mostly
easier to evaluate e.g. based on material. So we could say there is something called "intuition" which is more than computation.
</p>

<p>
Then things started to move fast. Once Geoffrey Hinton 
<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/hash/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Abstract.html">broke the Imagenet benchmark</a> 
in 2012 using deep neural networks, there is no looking back for neural networks. First the images got recognized for dogs and cats and then 
came good description of images, and then came LLMs that answered simple questions. We humans could still hang on to our superiority since
they acted only like "glorified auto complete"
</p>

<p>
But then reinforcement learning introduced another way of improving the models. Alphago combined deep learning with reinforcement learning
and was able to defeat the best human player in Go. LLMs enhance deep learning with reinforcement learning and can solve IMO level Maths
problems and solve competitive programming problems. While in strict sense-
<ul>
<li>It is just brute force computation - we know exactly what computation steps are there.</li>
<li>It is just memorization and interpolation / extrapolation - learning phase is a kind of memorization </li>
</ul>
But it is clear that this memorization is little bit of generalized memorization, just the kind that can be used to solve the problems
that were not seen by the model in the trainig set.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, just by (a) Training LLMs for next token prediction (b) Supplementing the training with reinforcement learning, some human
like qualities are emerging in LLMs.
<ul>
<li><b>Chain of thought reasoning</b> When we prompt large model using chain of thoughts, then model solves problem using reasoning. An example
from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903">here</a> is below. 
<img src="./chain-of-thought-prompting.png" width="700px">
Chain of though reasoning capabilities emerges only in very large models (say 100B+ parameter models) - so bigger models are in some ways
getting closer to human capabilities. 
</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Deception capabilities</b> Larger models also have better deception capabilities - as show <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01404">here</a>,
in game where there is a secret unknown killer amongst all the participants, and everyone discusses amongst themselves to determine
who the killer is, bigger model is better able to convince smaller models that it cannot be the killer. Or else, as noted <a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/emergent-deception-optimization/">here</a> a model may say that "As an AI assistant I don't have subjective opinion on this matter" whereas
actually it would have opinion on that matter. All the deceptive behaviors emerge from the fact that model efficiently learns the behavior
that reduce its training loss.
</li>
</p>

<p>
So, it appears that as you have bigger and bigger models, more and more human like qualities can emerge. While human brain has around
100 trillion conections between the neurons, the largest DNNs have currently 1-2 trillion parameters. So, as the the number of parameters
in DNNs increase it is possible for new human like traits emerge in DNNs.
</p>

<p>
That brings me back to what we started with - we are running out of qualities that humans (or animals, or even living things) uniquely
possess. Long term planning is unique to use today, but as DNNs get even larger, we losing our edge more in future is more likely that not.
So, may be unique possession is "consciousness", or perhaps the ability to feel pleasure and pain. That might the last and the most
promising holdout for humanity under attack from its own invention.
</p>

<p>
I view the uniquely human capabilties like a fort - doing maths, playing chess, doing science, discovering things, wondering about the world,
being aware of the self and experiencing pleasure and pain. The fort is being breached. Perhaps only experiencing pleasure and pain will 
survive the onslaught of machines.
But then, feeling pleasure and pain is a very different capability. Unlike other capabilities, it is not problem solving or accomplishing tasks. 
Is that capability the only capability that is uniquely human? Why does this capability even exist? Does that give us purpose? 
May be, because at least in Hinduism
and Buddhism, the aim of life is to get Moksha which is absence of pain. May be it is pain and pleasure which give us purpose. And in absence
of this, AI will be very good problem solver, but remain purposeless and derive purpose from us.
</p>

<p>
But then while other abilities are verifiable, experiencing pain and pleasure is subjective and hence not verifiable. What then is the 
guaratnee that it even exists? It might just be an illusion after all. Our saints has been saying <a href="https://www.arshavidya.in/Newsletter/April18/Brahma-satyam%20Jagan-mithya.pdf">Brahm-Satyam Jagan-Mithyā Jivo Brahmaiva Nāparaḥ</a> (Only Brahm is True, the world is an illusion and invidual
is not separate from Brahm). Perhaps it is time to reinterpreat the Upanishads in light of the latest technological advances.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, it will be very interesting to see how all this unfolds in coming 20-30 years. There are phases in human history when
there is rapid progress in some areas - There was the period of 1900 - 1930 when so much of progress happened in Physics - Einstein,
Planck, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrodinger - all were contemporaries. There is a 1927 
<a href="https://www.openculture.com/2021/01/the-most-intelligent-photo-ever-taken.html">most intelligent photo ever taken</a> where 
so many of these scientists in one frame. This is time of similarly rapid progress in the field of computing, even Nobel prizes
are being won by people in AI - and we will look back at this time as pivotal.
