<h1>Primal and Dual</h1>

<p>
Every since I learnt about primals and duals in linear programming I have been mesmerized by that concept. 
I have, passively, been observing this phenomena in diverse situations spanning Maths, Science and Philosophy. There are two different 
but equivalent ways of viewing a phenomena. Knowing the two ways sometimes helps in solving problems, and sometimes throws light
on the underlying phenomena and somtimes it is a bit frightening - attacking the hubris of mankind.
</p>

<p>
In this article we look at several cases of primal and dual.
</p>

<h3>Primal and dual in linear programming</h3>
<p>
To understand this, first we need to understand linear programming. Here is a primer on that.
</p>

<p>
In linear programming there are some linear constraints - either min value constraints or max value constraints - 
on some variables and subject to those constraints an linear
function of the variables needs to be optimised. Depending on type of constraints, there can be two types of linear problems -
primal or dual.
</p>
<p> Let's first see the first type of linear problem - the primal. To motivate this, let's say there is a factory which
produces  three products A, B, and C with the following constraints:

<ul>
<li>Machine time: Product A needs 2 hours, B needs 3 hours, C needs 1 hour</li>
<li>Labor time: Product A needs 1 hour, B needs 2 hours, C needs 3 hours </li>
<li>Raw material: Product A needs 3 kg, B needs 1 kg, C needs 2 kg</li>
<li>Available resources: 100 machine hours, 80 labor hours, 90 kg raw material</li>
<li>Profit per unit: A = $5, B = $4, C = $6</li>
</ul>

<p>
We need to decided how much of A, B and C to produce. If we want to produce $x_1$ units of A, $x_2$ units of
B and $x_3$ units C, we need to maximize

$$Z = 5x_1 + 4x_2 + 6x_3$$
subject to
$$2x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 \lte 100$$
$$x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 \lte 80$$
$$3x_1 + x_2 + 2x_3 \lte 90$$
$$x_1, x_2, x_3 \gte 0$$
