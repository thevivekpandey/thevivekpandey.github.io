<h1>QGProfiler: A Simple Profiler for Python Programs</h1>

<p>
A police officer sees a drunken man intently searching the ground near a lamppost 
and asks him the goal of his quest. The inebriate replies that he is looking for his 
car keys, and the officer helps for a few minutes without success then he asks whether 
the man is certain that he dropped the keys near the lamppost.
</p>

<p>
"No," is the reply, "I lost the keys somewhere across the street." "Why look here?" 
asks the surprised and irritated officer. "The light is much better here," the intoxicated 
man responds with aplomb. (<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/11/better-light/">source</a>)
</p>

<p>
As with inebriated man, we developers are prone to optimising parts of the program 
which are most amenable to optimisation, rather than the parts which take the largest 
amount of time. To help us guide in optimisation efforts, we need to profile our programs.
</p>

<h2>What is profiling?</h2>
<p>
Profiling a program refers to keeping track of times taken by various parts of a program. 
This helps us to find out the parts of the program that take most time. Those parts of the 
program should be the focus of optimisation efforts.
</p>

<p>
In all of the popular languages, there are some tools available for profiling. Most of them 
fall in two categories:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call graph profiling: </b>You ask compiler or interpreter to set a trace on each function 
call, and keep track of time taken by various functions. Thus you can figure out which 
functions take most of the execution time.</li>

<li><b>Sample profiling: </b>Every few milliseconds, you interrupt the program and check which 
function it is executing. Again, you can make inferences about which functions take most 
of the execution time.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The advantage of above methods is that there is little programming effort involved. The 
disadvantage is that either they may have a significant overhead (a one line function may 
be called millions of times, sampling period may be too small) or they may be too coarse 
grained to be useful.
</p>

<p>
As a result of above limitations, profiling is usually set off during production, and 
is enabled only in development/testing.
</p>

<p>
However, this is not an option for us, since production environment is very dynamic and 
unpredictable and it is not feasible for us to replicate it in dev/test settings. For us, 
performance optimisation is a first class activity, and we don’t mind instrumenting our 
code to facilitate accurate profiling.
</p>

<h2>Introducing QGProfiler</h2>
<p>
We realised that we needed a low overhead instrumentation framework, where we could 
manually specify the interesting portions of our program. There was no open source 
work which we found useful, and thus we have made a profiling framework which we call 
QGProfiler.
</p>

<p>
We have released its source code at <a href="https://github.com/quantumgraph/qgprofiler">https://github.com/quantumgraph/qgprofiler</a>.
</p>

<p>
QGProfiler works as following. You instantiate an object of QGProfiler, giving it a 
name, say "my-cool-program".
</p>

<pre>
qgprofiler = QGProfiler("my-cool-program", "/some/path/filename.json")
</pre>

<p>
As the program enters an interesting phase, you do a push:
</p>

<pre>
qgprofiler.push("some phase")
</pre>

<p>
When the interesting phase is over, you do a pop:
</p>

<pre>
qgprofiler.pop()
</pre>

<p>
Pushes and pops can be nested inside each other. QGProfiler keeps track of time taken 
by each node (determined by a push and pop). In the end, you call
</p>

<pre>
qgprofiler.generate_file()
</pre>

<p>
This call generates a file with the name specified in the constructor. If you call push() 
with same argument several times while being at particular point in the tree, the times will 
be added up, and one node will be generated with an overall count and total time taken for 
the stage.
</p>

<h2>Installing QGProfiler</h2>
<p>
Using pip:
</p>

<pre>
$ pip install qgprofiler
</pre>

<p>
Using setuptools:
</p>

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/quantumgraph/qgprofiler
$ cd qgprofiler
$ python setup.py install
</pre>

<h2>Using QGProfiler</h2>
<p>
Say you have a program:
</p>

<pre>
def f1():
   # some computation

def f2():
   # some computation

def f():
   data = f1()
   # do some manipulation on data. This is a heavy task
   # do some more manipulation. This should be light
   for i in range(100):
      f2()

def g():
   # some short computation

if __name__ == "__main__":
   f() # I think it takes a lot of time
   g() # This should not take a lot of time
</pre>

<p>
Now, you would like to know how much time various parts of this program take. You instrument your code like this:
</p>

<pre>
from QGProfiler import qgprofiler

def f1():
    # some computation

def f2(qgp):
    qgp.push('f2')
    # some computation
    qgp.pop()

def f(qgp):
    qgp.push('f1')
    data = f1() 
    qgp.push('heavy manipulation')
    # do some manipulation on data. This is a heavy task
    qgp.pop()
    # do some more manipulation. This should be light
    for i in range(100):
        f2(qgp)
    qgp.pop()

def g():
    # some short computation

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filename = &lt;a unique filename&gt;json
    qgp = QGProfiler('number-cruncher', filename)
    qgp.push('overall')
    qgp.push('f')
    f(qgp) # I think it takes a lot of time
    qgp.pop()
    g() # This should not take a lot of time
    qgp.pop()
    qgp.generate_file()
</pre>

<p>
At the end of this program, a file with the name specified by you will be 
generated, which contains content like the following:
</p>

<pre>
{
  "count": 1,
  "name": "number-cruncher",
  "value": 23.12,
  "children": [
    {
      "count": 1,
      "name": "overall",
      "value": 23.11,
      "children": [        
        {
          "count": 1,
          "name": "f",
          "value": 16.33,
          "children": [
            {
              "count": 1,
              "name": "f1",
              "value": 14.14,
              "children": [
                {

                  "count": 1,
                  "name": "heavy manipulation",
                  "value": 12.21,
                  "children": []
                },
                {
                  "count": 100,
                  "name": "f2",
                  "value": 1.20,
                  "children": []
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

<p>
Above json, throws following light on the program behavior:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
While 'overall' stage takes 23.11s, its only child 'f' takes only 16.33s. It means 
that our hypothesis, that the function g() does not take a lot of time is incorrect. 
We should put push()/pop() around g() too to track its time.
</li>

<li>
For f() most of the time goes in 'heavy manipulation', and f2(), although run 100 times, 
takes a small amount of time. Thus, our optimization efforts should be to reduce 
'heavy manipulation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Combining various output files
</p>

<p>
Let's say your program runs many times, and you generate one json file for each run of the 
program. Alternatively, your program may be forever running server, and you output one json 
file every hour.
</p>

<p>
You would like to see aggregated performance across various json files. For this, we provide a 
module called QGProfileAggregator. You use it like this:
</p>

<pre>
from qgprofiler import QGProfileAggregator
qg_aggregator = QGProfileAggregator('*.json', 'output.json')
qg_aggregator.generate_file()
</pre>

<p>
You do it like this:
</p>

<pre>
qg_aggregator = QGProfileAggregator('*.json', 'output.html')
qg_aggregator.generate_file()
</pre>

<p>
The flame graph consists of an interactive chart using which you can explore how much time various 
parts of your program take. This is what a sample flame graph for one of our programs looks like:

</p>

<h2>Usefulness</h2>

<p>
QGProfiler, and in particular its flame graph output has already helped us significantly to 
zoom in on areas of improvement. Compared to ad hoc approaches that we used earlier, this is 
like an X-ray, pointing us incisively to the parts of the program most deserving of 
optimisation efforts.
</p>

<h2> Upcoming improvements</h2>
<p>
There are several improvements planned:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Firstly, as QGProfiler is being used more and more extensively, there is a possibility that 
overheads of QGProfiler start becoming a significant fraction of running time. We will have 
QGProfiler output its own overhead (to the extent it is possible). If this overhead is large, 
we would need to eliminate some instrumentation to reduce the overhead.
</li>

<li>
We plan to provide facility where the programmer can attach some meta data to nodes while pushing 
them. The aggregator can then aggregate them (by using sum(), avg(), min() or max() functions) to  
find the metrics for parent nodes. For instance, one could attach peak memory utilisation at 
various nodes and float them up using max() function. Or else, one could attach number of db calls 
made, and float them up using sum() function.
</li>

<li>
Finally, we plan to write an agent for collecting the logs produced by QGProfiler, which would 
transfer it to a central server. A simple UI would access that central server and one would be 
able to view performance profiles for various components.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Try it out!</h2>
<p>
QGProfiler is deceptively simple to use, but extremely powerful. If you are thinking of making 
code changes to your python program to make it faster, try it out and you won’t be disappointed.
