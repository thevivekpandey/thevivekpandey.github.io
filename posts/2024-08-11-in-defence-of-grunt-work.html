<h1>In Defence of Grunt Work</h1>

<img width="300px" src="do-grunt-work.jpeg"/>
<em>In the zeal to do creative and scalable work, sometimes we may be avoiding the work that helps build intuition for creative and scalable work -- the grunt work. </em>
<p>
We, as in the people working in technology, emphasize on automation and scalability. Indeed, one of the gains of modern
computing is that it automates a lot of otherwise mundane tasks - starting from replacing human 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)">computers</a> (from whom the word "computer" originates in 
the first place) 
with modern computers, and continuing on with automation of bill payments, ticket booking, ordering merchandise, 
and now continuing on to driving cars and proving mathematical theorems. And as computing industry works to automate
the tasks it needs to solve scalability problems - the load on computers may reach unsustainable levels, and we need
to worry about ensuring the software and hardware are up to the task of handling the load that they are presented with.
This in turn spurs innovation, both in hardware and software to keep up with the scale of the load that is presented to
the modern computers.
</p>

<p>
Since the automation is raison d'Ãªtre for computing, many times, software engineers (an generally the people working in 
software companies) take automation and 
scalability as axiomatically good things. They overemphasize automation and 
scalability. They tend to automate things before they should be automated, and obsess about some solutions being non-scalable
at the stage where scalability should not be a concern. In this article I present a case for doing more grunt work than
we may deem healthy.
</p>

<p>
First, what do I mean by grunt work? We use it in sense of doing things which can be automated - like deleting
files with some pattern in the filename one by one, rather than deleting all of them together using a regex, or checking
again and again for errors rather than setting up an alarm for the error, or copying things from some UI to excel laboriously 
when you could write software (with how much effort?) to do the copying. Or, on a more advanced level, reviewing resumes
via some tool rather than manually (else resume review does not scale), or responding to customer tickets using automated
solutions rather than manually (which also does not scale).
</p>

<p>
On some level, the boundary between grunt work and non-grunt work (let's call it "creative work") is blurry and keeps changing.
Creating a beautiful logo used to be a very creative activity, but now that can be done by gen AI models. Is that now a
grunt work or creative work? Programming is considered to be a very creative activity, but as many people learn programming,
aspects of it can be thought to be grunt work (like, at least, writing boiler plate code, routine CRUD APIs, etc).
</p>

<p>
Perhaps then, we can distinguish between grunt work and non grunt work as - when the job is so routine and mundane that one
is hardly going to be learn anything new by doing it then that is grunt work. At what learning rate we draw the boundary
is our choice - one may say driving in the city is grunt work, but then you do face unexpected situations, at least in Indian
cities, and your driving keeps on improving. 
</p>

<p>
We will leave it at that and not attempt to further distinguish between grunt work and creative work. We will consider examples given above (copying files, etc) as the examples of grunt work.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you want to track 
certain metric - like average or p99 response time of a server, or number of 5xx responses by a server. Many a times, the 
mindset is - let's put an alarm of these metrics so that when they breach a certain threshold, then we get notified and then
we will solve the problem. This works, and indeed this is the scalable way if you have 100s or 1000s of metrics to track. However
such an automated way precludes us building better intuition about those metrics. If we start looking at the charts of these
metrics of a daily basis, then we build a better understanding of those metrics - how do they vary by the day of the hour, or by 
the day of the week, or how they have been changing gradually over long periods of time, or how some of the recent changes
in the code have made those metrics go up or down. Such a nuanced understanding of the metrics help us build better software.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, let's say you decided to delete all the large files from some file system. It is easy to write some command like 
<pre>
$find /path/to/directory -type f -size +10G -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
</pre>
but it is instructive to go file by file, to see what are the files whose size large. Who creates them? For what purpose? That way, one learns about the system better.
</p>


<p>
Of course, one cannot have the time to do everything in a grunt way, but my point is that there is value in devoting
some fraction of the time for grunt work. Grunt work helps one build better intuition about the systems.
</p>

<p>
I sometimes find grunt work akin to a walk in the park. Walk in the park is not very productive - it is idle roaming. However,
during the times of this idle roaming, you can sometime get good ideas about your work, and walk in the parks is quite easy 
also - you are not doing anything difficult or unknown. Similarly grunt work is also very easy, and can sometime spark ideas
about how some things can be done in a different, more innovative way. Of course, you don't walk in the park all day, similarly
you don't do grunt work all day.
</p>

<p>
This whole grunt work thing is similar to Paul Graham's advice about <a href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html">doing things that don't scale</a>. That advice is about macro things - sales, customer delight, and the like, and this is about more micro acivities.
</p>

<p>
When dealing with data, grunt work often gives you intuition about what is going on. Suppose you need to
find the average of a large list of numbers. You can just compute it and consume the output. However, if you start looking
at some of the individual numbers, you may be able to spot some patterns, that may motiviate you to get more statistics about
the list, and then you may be able to better understand the phenomena that you are summarising by the average.
</p>

<p>
In closing, we should devote some fraction of our time doing grunt work, or the walk in the park type of work, which can help us build
better intuition about the dynamics of the system.
