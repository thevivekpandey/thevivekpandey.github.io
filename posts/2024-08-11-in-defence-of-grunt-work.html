<h1>In Defence of Grunt Work</h1>

<img width="300px" src="some-image.jpeg"/>
<p>
We, as in the people working in technology, emphasize on automation and scalability. Indeed, one of the gains of modern
computing is that it automates a lot of otherwise mundane tasks - starting from replacing human 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)">computers</a> (from whom the word "computer" originates in 
the first place) 
with modern computers, and continuing on with automation of bill payments, ticket booking, ordering merchandise, 
and now continuing on to driving cars and proving mathematical theorems. And as computing industry works to automate
the tasks it needs to solve scalability problems - the load on computers may reach unsustainable levels, and we need
to worry about ensuring the software and hardware are up to the task of handling the load that they are presented with.
This in turn spurs innovation, both in hardware and software to keep up with the scale of the load that is presented to
the modern computers.

<p>
Since the automation is main raison d'Ãªtre for computing, many times, software engineers sometimes take automation and 
scalability as axiomatically good things. They overemphasize automation and 
scalability. They tend to automate things before they should be automated, and obsess about some solutions being non-scalable
at the stage where scalability should not be a concern. In this article I present a case for doing more grunt work than
we may deem healthy.
